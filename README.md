# Metal – Basic Code Repository

This repository contains **basic reference code** and structural components of the Metal project.  

⚠️ **Important Notice**  
- Many critical parts are **intentionally missing**.  
- Some sections have been **modified or obfuscated** to avoid exposing sensitive aspects of **JINX**, the core engine behind Metal.  
- This repository is provided **for reference only**. It is not intended for testing, deployment, or production use.

## About Metal
Metal is a **next-generation contactless payment solution** that bypasses traditional card networks.  
Our mission is to deliver a payment system that is:  
- **Affordable** – lower transaction costs for merchants.  
- **Reliable** – designed for modern devices and offline resilience.  
- **Secure** – built with strong cryptography and device-level protection.

## Repository Contents
- **Example modules** – Show the general structure of Metal’s codebase.  
- **Stubbed code** – Placeholder methods where proprietary logic has been removed.  
- **Reference flows** – Simplified transaction outlines for illustration.

## What’s Missing
The following are **not included** in this repository:  
- JINX (Metal’s secure processing and decision layer).  
- Encryption, authentication, and key management.  
- Proprietary transaction protocols.  
- Cloud, networking, and production infrastructure.
